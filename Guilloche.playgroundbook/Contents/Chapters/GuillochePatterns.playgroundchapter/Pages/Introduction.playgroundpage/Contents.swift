 # Introduction
 
 **Ever wondered why every dollar bill contains this cool looking geometrical grid?**

 It's not just the dollar bill. This pattern is called a **Guilloché pattern** and it can be seen on any kind of printed material that we want to protect from counterfeiting.
 
 It can be seen on stamps, alcohol and tobacco seals, paper currency etc. I bet you seen one in the wild, but you never even thought about it. This is one of those design & engineering masterpieces you never think of, but plays an amazing role in our everyday lives.
 
 ## How can this stop counterfeiters?
 Guilloché pattern are really complex pieces of artwork that **cannot be scanned and reprinted** in a way that it would not be detectable. Scanners simply can't catch all of the intricate details of the pattern and regular printers can't reproduce them. They are often engraved or stamped on materials to provide an impeccable structure of the print.
 
 Guilloché patterns also act like physical hash functions. Meaning drawing one from a set of parameters is easy, but trying to guess those parameters from a drawing is almost impossible. This means that this pattern cannot be scanned or recreated.
 
 **Making it an invaluable security tool for physical objects.**
